        Music is my passion! I love playing guitar,
        singing, and recently have even been taking drum lessons. Writing songs and jamming
        with other musicians connects me to the world ðŸ¤˜. I'm in a few bands and I also produce
        some of my own music on the side. I love to play live and have played at a few
        venues in New York City with my bands.

        listening!
